Backend
Organized Code:

Three APIs for modular functionality:
/validate-url: Validates YouTube URLs.
/download-video: Downloads the video from YouTube.
/process-video: Processes the downloaded video with a background image.
Error Handling:

Clear and meaningful error messages are sent back to the frontend for invalid inputs or failed steps.
Prevents backend crashes with robust try-catch blocks.
Scalability:

The code is modular and ready for future enhancements or additional features.
